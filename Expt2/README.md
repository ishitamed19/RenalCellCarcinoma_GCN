An implementation of the paper: [Cancer subtype classification and modeling by pathway attention and propagation](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article-abstract/36/12/3818/5811233?redirectedFrom=fulltext)

### Implementation
* INPUT:
  - KEGG Pathways
  - Gene expression profile with cancer subtype 
* OUTPUT:
  - Subtype Classification
  - Importance of pathways with interaction information 
 
- [x] GCN Model (ChebNet) for each pathway (111 pathways -> 111 models) 
- [x] Attention-based ensemble model : To find out the contribution of each pathway towards predicting that patientâ€™s class 

### Results
1. Trained an ensemble of 11 attention-based models
2. Used 5-fold cross-validation
